Question 1. There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.

Answer: Artificial intelligence is a form of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence - this is the process of simulating the human brain on a computer. In other words, artificial intelligence is the creation of a conscious computer.

Question 2. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?

Answer:

- Relationship between the three concepts:

Artificial Intelligence is the concept of creating smart intelligent machines. 

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that helps you build AI-driven applications.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses vast volumes of data and complex algorithms to train a model.

- Similarities between the 3 concepts:

Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning all use algorithms to process and analyze data.

Was born to serve the basic needs of people.

- Differences between the three concepts:

AI describes the concept of human-type intelligence in machines.

Deep learning can automate the entire learning process without human intervention.

Machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn.

Machine learning and deep learning are efforts towards creating a General AI.

Question 3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.

One area of very successful AI application at the moment is autonomous driving.
The AI system collects data from the vehicle's radar, camera and GPS to generate a signal and feeds that data into the system to control and operate the vehicle. Algorithms can almost accurately predict what behaviors objects in the vicinity of the vehicle are likely to perform. This makes the vehicle more efficient and safer. Tesla is one of the most famous examples of self-driving cars. AI deploys computer vision, image detection, and positioning to create cars that can automatically detect objects and the safest driving route without human intervention.

Question 4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.

Answer: Chips for Deep Neural Networks and Ascend AI Processors: chips capable of parallel computing.

A central processing unit (CPU)

A graphics processing unit (GPU)

An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)

A field programmable gate array (FPGA)

Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE-2), Lightmatter, SambaNova Systems, Tenstorrent, Mythic,...

Brief the four major modules.

A central processing unit (CPU): a super-large-scale integrated circuit, which is the computing core and control unit of a computer. It can interpret computer instructions and process computer software data. 

A graphics processing unit (GPU): a display core, visual processor, and display chip. It is a microprocessor that processes images on personal computers, workstations, game consoles, and mobile devices, such as tablet computers and smart phones. 

An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC): an integrated circuit designed for a specific purpose. 

A field programmable gate array (FPGA): designed to implement functions of a semi-customized chip. The hardware structure can be flexibly configured and changed in real time based on requirements.

Question 5. Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.

In my opinion, artificial intelligence is the trend of mankind, in the era of modernization, the automation of the entire process is prevalent, the application of machine learning and AI in all fields is increasing sharply in the future. Recently, by an AI prediction algorithm, it has been shown that the development of AI by 2050 is on all fields. Autonomous vehicles, autonomous aircraft, chatPGT, virtual assistants, ... are the most practical applications and also the foundation for the development of AI. The future development trend of AI will be about the ability to predict and give the most optimal solution to the problem, predict the potential in production, predict the market trend. This is also a strong point and characteristic of AI
